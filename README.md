Here is the source code for the project with all the assets, can be loaded directly as a project into unity and be tested etc.
The scripts required for the Database have been added, as well as the SQL. These have to be either applied to a server db manager or localhost, and then initialised with the SQL.
If correctly done, Urls within the C# scripts will also need to be modified so the URLs go to the correct locations of the PHP files.
